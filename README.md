# Modular Times Tables

Interactive modular multiplication tables plotted on a circle.

## Compile (Gradle)

1. Download and extract anywhere.
2. Open the terminal in the directory with the gradle.build script file
3. Type: gradle build run

## Instructions

Select the modulus number M (number of subdivisions of the circle) and
the multiplier N. Counting counter-clockwise from the east, a line is
drawn from each mark on the circle to the result of that number's
modular multiplication by N.

## Features (keyboard input)

ESC => end program

N => edit multiplier

M => edit modulo

UP => add 1 to current value

DOWN => subtract 1 from current value

SHIFT + UP => add 0.01 if editing N, else add 1

SHIFT + DOWN => subtract 0.01 if editing N, else sub 1
